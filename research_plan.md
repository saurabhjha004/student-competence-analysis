# Python Student Competence Analysis: Research Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive research plan for evaluating open-source AI models to assess Python student competence and generate meaningful educational prompts. The research focuses on **CodeBERT (microsoft/codebert-base)** as the primary model, combined with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis to create a novel hybrid approach for educational assessment.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
Develop and evaluate an AI-powered system that can:
- Analyze student-written Python code for structural and semantic patterns
- Generate educational prompts that assess conceptual understanding
- Identify gaps in reasoning and common programming misconceptions
- Encourage deeper learning without revealing direct solutions

### Secondary Objectives
- Establish evaluation criteria for educational AI model effectiveness
- Create a reusable framework for programming education assessment
- Demonstrate scalable deployment potential for classroom environments
- Contribute novel insights to educational technology research

## Research Plan

### Approach to Model Identification and Evaluation

My research methodology focuses on systematic evaluation of **CodeBERT (microsoft/codebert-base)** as the optimal open-source model for student competence analysis. The approach combines multi-dimensional assessment through Abstract Syntax Tree structural analysis with CodeBERT's semantic understanding capabilities, creating a hybrid system that captures both syntactic patterns and deep code comprehension. Evidence-based misconception detection implements pattern recognition derived from educational research on common Python learning difficulties, while pedagogically-informed prompt generation develops educational questioning systems based on established learning theory and Socratic methodology. This comprehensive framework ensures both technical accuracy and educational effectiveness by integrating traditional program analysis with modern transformer-based natural language processing.

The evaluation framework prioritizes models that demonstrate semantic code understanding beyond surface-level syntax checking, pedagogical adaptability through fine-tuning capabilities, and explainable decision-making processes that educators can understand and validate. CodeBERT was selected after comprehensive analysis of alternatives including traditional static analysis tools, generic language models, and specialized programming assessment frameworks. The selection criteria emphasized proven performance in code comprehension tasks, demonstrated educational applications in literature, open-source availability for customization, and active community support ensuring continued development and maintenance.

### Validation and Testing Methodology

The evaluation framework employs multiple validation approaches to ensure educational effectiveness and technical robustness. Technical performance validation includes comprehensive testing of AST feature extraction accuracy, CodeBERT embedding generation consistency, and integrated analysis pipeline performance under various code complexity scenarios. Educational effectiveness assessment implements research-backed metrics including prompt relevance to learning objectives, alignment with educational taxonomy frameworks, consistency across similar code patterns, and pedagogical impact measurement through simulated learning outcome analysis.

Misconception detection validation tests the system against curated datasets of known Python programming errors including variable scoping issues, mutability confusion patterns, function definition misconceptions, and algorithmic logic errors. The validation process employs expert educator review panels to assess pedagogical soundness, comparative analysis against human-generated assessment materials, and iterative refinement based on feedback from educational practitioners. Long-term validation includes classroom deployment testing to measure real-world effectiveness, student engagement metrics, and learning outcome improvements over extended periods.
